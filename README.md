# Project-1-War

# Introduction to the Project
Game of War. \
Functionality --
Game starts with 52 cards & deck is split evenly between the two players

If Player 1 Card > Player 2 Card, both cards go into Player 1â€™s deck & goal is to get all 52 cards

Given this is a prototype I currently have a tie just being pushed back to their players respective decks 

# Show/Discuss Code
o	Set empty arrays for player 1 & player 2

o	Created constant variable arrays for suits, values and scores and integrated them into a for loop to get my card deck

o	Created a function with a for loop to shuffle the deck

o	Slice method to split up the shuffled deck into the empty player 1 and player 2 arrays

o	From there I used pop to pull a card out from each players array & created a function to compare the two cards using if else statements
